# 📄 OdooEasyInvoiceOCR  

### 🚀 About the Project  
The **OdooEasyInvoiceOCR** is a module for **Odoo** that uses **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to automatically process invoices. The goal is to extract relevant data from invoices and tax documents, reducing manual work and integrating efficiently with the Odoo ERP system.  

This project is being developed by the **Diverse Bytes** team for **FOSS FEST 2025**, as part of a **FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)** initiative.
