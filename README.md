# 📄 OdooEasyInvoiceOCR  

### 🚀 About the Project  
**OdooEasyInvoiceOCR** is a module for **Odoo** that utilizes **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to process invoices automatically. The goal is to extract relevant data from invoices and financial documents, reducing manual work and efficiently integrating with Odoo's ERP system.  

This project is being developed by the **Diverse Bytes** team for **FOSS FEST 2025**, as part of a **FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)** initiative.  

### ⚠️ Project Status: **In Development**  
🚧 This project is still in its early development phase. If you want to contribute or follow the progress, feel free to follow the repository! 🚧  

### 📌 Main Objectives  
✔️ Automate invoice data extraction using OCR  
✔️ Integrate with Odoo's Vendor Bill module  
✔️ Support multiple invoice formats (PDF, JPG, PNG)  
✔️ Reduce manual errors and optimize financial management  

### 🛠️ Planned Technologies  
- **Odoo** (specific version)  
- **EasyOCR** (Open-source OCR based on PyTorch)  
- **Python**  
- **PostgreSQL** (Odoo's Database)

### 🔄 Vendor Bill - Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of Purchase Invoices  
This module will allow users to upload images and extract text from them. The module should integrate with an OCR library or an AI tool to extract text from the uploaded images. It should be able to upload files of various formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, PDF). A workflow will be created to automatically import extracted invoice data into Odoo's **Vendor Bill module**.
